## Description

Users will be able to view a Shelters' index page and view all of the available shelters where pets can be adopted from. Users will also be able to view a Pets index page where they can
see all of the pets belonging to all of the shelters. 

Users will also be able to visit a specific shelter and view the pets that shelter has at that time, as well as see
those pets' current adoption status. If you find a pet you like, you are able to favorite the pet and then apply for it! If you have had a good (or bad) experience with a specific shelter, you will be able to leave a review for that shelter so future adopters are able to see how users have experienced their services in the past. 

Each individual shelter will have statistics regarding their pets and their overall reviews, as well as how many pet applications have been submitted on pets at their shelters.

Adopt Don't Shop is a great way to find your next furry friend and is an easy guide for you, the user, to find which shelter will work best with you to find your newest family member.
